    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Fake facial images and videos created by AI have become a serious social problem. As deepfake technology improves and becomes easier to use, more people can make realistic fake media that looks like real people. These deepfakes enable identity theft, where criminals can pretend to be someone else. They help spread false information, like fake news videos of political figures saying things they never said. They damage trust in online media because people cannot tell what is real anymore. And they invade privacy when someone's face is used without permission in fake content that may be harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project tackles this problem by creating a deepfake detection system that can analyze facial images and determine whether they are authentic or AI-generated. Our system takes any facial image as input through either a web API or command-line interface and processes it using our custom neural network based on ResNet50 with spatial attention. This specialized architecture analyzes subtle patterns and inconsistencies that typically appear in AI-generated images but are often invisible to the human eye. After analysis, the system provides a prediction output with a binary verdict (REAL or FAKE) along with confidence scores showing the probability percentages for both classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our technical approach follows a structured pipeline that begins with a balanced dataset of real and fake facial images. We extract features using our modified ResNet50 that focuses on discriminative facial regions, and then perform binary classification enhanced with Focal Loss to prioritize difficult cases. We've made this technology accessible through simple interfaces for real-world application. In testing, our model achieved 93.58% overall accuracy, with 100% recall for real faces, demonstrating its effectiveness as a practical defensive tool against the growing threat of deepfakes. "

By randomly cropping to a slightly smaller size with scale factors between 0.8 and 1.0, we force the model to focus on different facial regions rather than memorizing specific pixel positions, which significantly improves robustness against simple repositioning attempts.\n",
    "* 3. **Random Horizontal Flip:** Creates mirror images during training, helping the model learn features regardless of facial orientation. This is particularly important since natural facial asymmetries can be disrupted in deepfakes, and the model needs to detect these inconsistencies regardless of orientation.\n",
    "* 4. **Color Jitter:** Adjusts brightness (±20%), contrast (±20%), saturation (±10%), and hue (±10%) to simulate different lighting conditions and camera settings. This prevents the model from relying on color distribution anomalies that might be specific to our training data rather than inherent to deepfakes.\n",
    "* 5. **Normalization:** Uses ImageNet mean and standard deviation values to normalize pixel values, which is essential for the pre-trained ResNet50 model that expects this specific data distribution.\n",

    "* **BATCH_SIZE = 24**: Selected based on a trade-off between GPU memory limitations and training stability. A smaller batch size would result in noisy gradients and unstable convergence, while a larger size could lead to out-of-memory issues. This value yielded consistent results with acceptable memory usage.\n",
    "* **LEARNING_RATE = 0.0002**: Determined through grid search. A higher learning rate led to oscillations in loss, while lower rates slowed convergence. This value provided a good balance of convergence speed and stability, especially when fine-tuning pretrained ResNet50 weights.\n",
    "* **WEIGHT_DECAY = 1e-5**: Acts as a regularization term to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights. Lower values failed to sufficiently regularize the model, while higher values underfit the training data. This value was optimal during cross-validation.\n",
    "* **EPOCHS = 20**: Selected based on early stopping criteria observed in validation performance. Although convergence often occurred earlier (around epoch 14), training was continued to 20 epochs to stabilize accuracy and allow learning rate scheduling to take effect.\n",
    "* **AdamW Optimizer**: We chose AdamW over standard Adam because it implements a more effective weight decay regularization that's decoupled from the learning rate schedule. This helps maintain the pretrained weights' knowledge while allowing effective fine-tuning for our specific task.\n",
    "* **ReduceLROnPlateau Scheduler**: This learning rate scheduler reduces the learning rate by 50% when validation loss plateaus for 3 consecutive epochs, allowing the model to make rapid progress initially and then fine-tune with smaller steps as it approaches the optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "These optimization choices created a training environment that balanced efficiency, stability, and generalization ability, leading to our final model's high performance on the test set. We took help from ChatGPT and other AI models to make our implementation more accurate. Initially, we experimented with standard Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, but based on suggestions from chatbots and Google search results and some research paper for similar deepfake detection tasks, we adopted these more advanced techniques which significantly improved our model's performance.\n"

    "## 8. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we have developed a robust deep learning system for detecting AI-generated facial images, achieving 93.58% accuracy with perfect recall for real faces. Our approach integrated multiple techniques: constructing a balanced dataset with careful train-test separation, implementing diverse data augmentation, designing a custom ResNet50 classifier with spatial attention, and optimizing performance through focal loss and systematic hyperparameter tuning. While gathering sufficient high-quality data posed significant challenges, our custom architecture successfully focuses on subtle facial inconsistencies that reveal AI manipulation, demonstrating how transfer learning can effectively address even complex classification tasks with limited training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system's performance metrics particularly its perfect recall for authentic images make it suitable for real-world deployment through either our FastAPI-powered REST service or command-line interface. Our implementation ensures versatility across different operational environments while maintaining high accuracy on challenging test cases. The strategic error distribution (preferring false positives over false negatives) aligns with practical requirements for content verification systems, though addressing the current tendency toward false positives remains an opportunity for future refinement, along with expanding demographic representation in our training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are excited about the future potential of this technology and committed to further enhancements: extending to video-based detection, exploring lightweight architectures for mobile deployment, incorporating multimodal analysis combining visual and metadata features, and implementing active learning to improve performance on edge cases. Our ultimate vision is to see this technology integrated into content verification systems across social media, news organizations, and legal frameworks, preserving trust in digital media and protecting individuals from identity-based fraud and misinformation. This project exemplifies how AI can be responsibly deployed to counteract the very risks that AI itself creates, truly embodying \"AI for the Betterment of Society.\""
