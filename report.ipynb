    "\n",
    "The proliferation of artificially generated or manipulated facial content presents significant societal challenges. As generative AI technology becomes increasingly accessible, the ability to create convincing \"deepfakes\" that can impersonate real people raises concerns about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Misinformation and disinformation** in political, social, and economic contexts\n",
    "- **Identity theft and fraud** targeting individuals and organizations\n",
    "- **Erosion of trust** in digital media and evidence\n",
    "- **Privacy violations** through unauthorized facial manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project addresses these challenges by developing a deep learning system capable of distinguishing between authentic human faces and those generated or manipulated by AI. This aligns directly with the course theme of \"AI for the Betterment of Society\" by leveraging artificial intelligence as a defensive measure against potentially harmful applications of the same technology."

    "In this project, we developed a robust deep learning system capable of detecting AI-generated and manipulated facial images — commonly referred to as deepfakes. By integrating multiple machine learning techniques, we were able to build, train, and evaluate a classifier with strong generalization performance on unseen test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began by constructing a balanced dataset of real and fake face images, ensuring proper separation between training and test sets. To improve model generalization, we applied diverse data augmentation techniques that simulate real-world variability while preserving essential facial structures. This data pipeline was implemented in train.py and model.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then designed a custom classifier based on ResNet50 with an additional spatial attention mechanism. This architecture, implemented in model.py, allows the model to focus on subtle, often-overlooked details in facial regions — key for identifying deepfakes. The use of transfer learning helped speed up convergence and reduced the need for training on very large datasets from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our training process, scripted in train.py, used focal loss to better handle potential class imbalance and placed emphasis on harder-to-classify examples. Careful hyperparameter tuning — including batch size, learning rate, weight decay, and dropout rates — led to a model that was both accurate and generalizable. These hyperparameters were selected through systematic experimentation and validated through metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "During evaluation (test.py), the model achieved 93.58% accuracy, with perfect recall for real images and high precision. This performance is suitable for real-world applications, particularly where detecting manipulated images is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment capabilities were ensured by developing both a FastAPI-powered REST API (main.py) and a CLI for batch processing (test.py). These interfaces make it easy to use the model in different operational environments, whether integrated into web apps or local automation scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our system performs well, there is room for future enhancement. Addressing the bias toward false positives, expanding the dataset to cover more real-world diversity, and incorporating video-based detection are all promising avenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project exemplifies how AI can be responsibly used to counteract the risks posed by AI itself — a true demonstration of \"AI for the Betterment of Society.\"\n"
